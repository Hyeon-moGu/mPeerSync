## Overview

mPeerSync is a lightweight tool for syncing files between devices on the same LAN.  
Peers are discovered automatically using mDNS. When a file is added to the `outbox/` directory, it is split into chunks, signed, and sent to connected peers. Peers reassemble the file in their `inbox/` directory and verify its signature.

## Project Structure

```
mPeerSync/
â”œâ”€â”€ crypto/      # Key handling
â”œâ”€â”€ file/        # Chunking and watcher
â”œâ”€â”€ peer/        # Discovery and connection
â”œâ”€â”€ util/        # Logging helpers
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Build binary
go build -o mpeersync

# Generate key pair (once per peer)
./mpeersync --keymake

# Run instance on a specific port
./mpeersync --port 1234
```

Each peer watches `../sync/outbox/`
New files are sent to discovered peers and saved in their `../sync/inbox/`

## Security

- Files are signed with Ed25519 private keys
- Signature verification uses public keys in the receiverâ€™s `../keys/` folder
- If verification fails, the file is still saved and a warning is logged
